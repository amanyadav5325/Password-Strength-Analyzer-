🔐 Password Strength Analyzer – Project Summary

🎯 Objective:

To build a tool that analyzes the strength of user-entered passwords and provides feedback based on security criteria, helping users create stronger, more secure passwords.

🧱 Key Features:

1. Password Input:

User inputs a password via a simple interface (CLI, GUI, or web form).



2. Evaluation Criteria:

Length of password

Use of uppercase and lowercase letters

Very Strong



4. Visual Feedback:

Color-coded indicators (e.g., red = weak, green = strong)

Suggestions for improvement (e.g., “Add special characters”)



5. Optional Features:

Real-time feedback as user types

Integration with breached-password databases (e.g., Have I Been Pwned API)
